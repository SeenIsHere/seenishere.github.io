    <p>The FitnessGram™ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues.
The 20-meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start.
The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal.
A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound.
Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible.
The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over.
The test will begin on the word start.
On your mark, get ready, start.</p>
